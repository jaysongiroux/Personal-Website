            "Hi! My name is Jason Giroux and I enjoy making web and desktop applications that both look pretty and are powerful. My interest in software engineering sparked when I was 18 while I was a camp consular at a computer camp. A peer of mine introduced me to python; since then, itâ€™s been a constant passion to learn new languages, frameworks and focusing on problem solving. ",
            "I have had the privilege to work in numerous internships since I was 16 in high-tech companies. While in college I interned for Markforged, Citizens Bank, Applause Inc., and Reserve Technology. These Internships introduced me to frontend, backend, database management and optimization. The experiences and projects I worked on lead me down a well-rounded path where I found my love to full stack development and robotics.",
